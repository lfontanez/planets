# 3D Solar System Visualization

A web-based 3D visualization of our solar system built with Three.js. This project was developed as a test case using Aider with Claude-3.5-Sonnet AI assistant.

## Features

- Interactive 3D visualization of the solar system
- Realistic relative orbital periods (scaled)
- Planet size scaling controls
- Simulation speed controls
- Toggleable orbital paths
- Planet labels
- Full camera controls (rotate, pan, zoom)

## Technologies Used

- Three.js for 3D rendering
- CSS2DRenderer for planet labels
- OrbitControls for camera manipulation

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in a modern web browser. The visualization will start automatically.

### Controls

- Left click + drag to rotate the view
- Right click + drag to pan
- Scroll wheel to zoom in/out
- Use the control panel to adjust:
  - Simulation speed
  - Planet sizes
  - Orbit visibility

## Development

This project was developed as a test case for using Aider with Claude-3.5-Sonnet AI assistant. It demonstrates the capabilities of AI-assisted coding while creating an educational and interactive visualization tool.
